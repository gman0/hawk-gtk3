What is it?
-----------
hawk-gtk3 is a GTK3 backend for libhawk file-manager

Building
--------
hawk-gtk3 is written in C++11 so you'll need a C++11 compliant compiler
(that'd be g++ >=4.8.1 or llvm/clang >=3.0).

hawk-gtk3 is using CMake build system so before you start make sure it's
installed on your system.

Other than that, hawk-gtk3 has these dependencies:
	* libhawk (obviously)
	* gtkmm-3.0

As for the actual building:
	cd to your build directory (let's say ./build/)
	$ cd build/

	tell cmake where's the libhawk's CMake config file
	$ cmake ../src

	run make
	$ make

	(optional) now you can install hawk-gtk3 to make it available
	system-wide
	# make install

An executable file will be built in your build directory.
